# Detecting people not following covid norms and masks over face
It has been almost 3 years that we are facing the wrath of COVID-19 all over the world affecting
the lives of many people. India is also not far away from this. India recorded one of the worst effects
of COVID leading to the economical crisis. Lots of people lost their lives. Lockdown was imposed
leading to strain on the world economy. After the two waves got over, relaxations were given. WHO
gave instructions on how to take care of this virus. They said that mask is a great weapon to keep
coronavirus away. Proper sanitization should be maintained whenever people go out. People after
getting relaxed in covid regulations started going out. Often we saw people not maintaining social
distancing when going out in public places. As we know how important it is to maintain social
distancing, sanitization, and wearing masks when we go out in public. After the revocation of covid
rules, we have seen people going out in crowded places without masks and maintaining social
distance. Surveys tell that almost 90% of people are aware whereas only 40 percent of people wear
masks. From these surveys, we will say that people often neglect to wear masks either because they
are not comfortable or they don’t believe that there is such a thing called covid. This kind of
behavior by people leads to the quick spread of covid viruses rapidly affecting the lives of many
people. The WHO has thus said that only wearing masks and maintaining social distancing is the
key to keeping away the virus. The areas where people are freely moving without masks are the
key culprits. Also, the people living in rural areas where there is no proper awareness, need to be
aware of these facts and tips to keep away these viruses. This uncertain outbreak of the COVID-19
virus has led us to the importance of wearing masks in public places and keeping us safe from such
viruses

# Objective 
The objective of this model is to design and develop a model that helps us to identify those people
who aren’t wearing masks either due to lack of awareness or negligence. It is created by the use of
MobileNet V2, Face Recognition Library, and Twilio.

# Problem Statement 
Nowadays, carrying masks is a critical want in public places, because, to a large extent, it will
become hard for protection officers to check each and every individual who is no longer wearing a
mask. Therefore, it is important to identify those people and make them aware of the importance of
wearing masks.
